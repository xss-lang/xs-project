# xs-project

`xs-project` is the Kotlin/JVM 25 resolver for programmable project files. It invokes the required external
`kotlin` command and emits a deterministic versioned project plan or exact source registry for the X# command-line
driver. It never reads or compiles `.xs` files. The compiler and
JRE are not embedded: JRE 25 or newer and an executable `kotlin` scripting command are runtime requirements.

Projects use one `xs.project.kts` file or the `xs.settings.kts` + `xs.build.kts` pair. Only
`project(name, channel, version)` is required. `source.include` names recursive directory
roots; source/test excludes may use `*`, `**`, and `?` glob patterns. A case-sensitive `main.xs` is placed first when it
exists, but it is not required for library-only projects. Setting `XS_EXTENSION` replaces the selected suffix and the
recognized `main`/`lib` filenames. Optional sections cover authors, external modules,
multi-value settings such as `TARGET`, tests, compiler diagnostics, variables, and host-dependent `cfg(...)` branches. See `xs.project.kts` for the complete
working DSL example.

External coordinates use `addModule(name, stability, version)`. A successful modern project evaluation writes the exact
selection to the reproducible `xs.lock.sqlite3` SQLite lock file in the project root. The current resolver does not fetch
the declared modules yet.

`PUBLISH` is a single boolean project variable with a `false` default; it currently records publication intent without
performing a registry upload.

`BUILD_MODE` defaults to `Release`; `RELEASE_OUTDIR` and `DEBUG_OUTDIR` default to `build/release` and `build/debug`.
`XSPKG_TYPE` accepts a list containing `xlib`, `dylib`, `staticlib`, `cdylib`, and `bin`. If omitted, `lib.xs` infers
`xlib`, `main.xs` infers `bin`, and both files infer both artifacts. These filenames are inference inputs, not mandatory
project files.

When no source block is present, the resolver behaves as if `source { include("Sources") }` were written.
An existing project-root `Modules` directory is likewise the default module include; without that directory the module
registry defaults to empty.
Without an explicit test include, each effective source root contributes its existing `Test` child directory. Missing
default test directories are ignored and leave an empty test registry.

Source, module, and test exclusion metadata defaults to `*/**`. It is consumed by editor views and xspkg packaging,
not by compiler source discovery. Supplying exclusions replaces the category's default metadata; empty `exclude()` clears
it. Include roots remain recursive and authoritative for compiler input.
Resolved compiler registries cannot overlap: test roots win over module assignments, and module assignments win over
general source roots. The same physical file is emitted in at most one registry.
Each `source`, `test`, and `module` block accepts `filter(listOf(...))`; omitted filters are populated from the other two
effective include registries after filesystem defaults are known.

Non-canonical entry files use `set("BINARY", mapOf("name" to "tool", "path" to "Sources/tool.xs"))` or the analogous
`LIBRARY` setting. Multiple maps define multiple named artifacts, matching repeated `[[bin]]`/`[[lib]]` records.

In split mode, `xs.settings.kts` is evaluated before `xs.build.kts`, but sections are not assigned to either filename.
Both scripts may use the full DSL; the second script extends the state produced by the first.

The canonical recursive source form is:

```kotlin
source {
  include("Sources")
  exclude("Sources/tests/**")
}
```

Include roots do not accept globs. Discovery is recursive relative to the project root; exclude metadata is not applied
to compiler inputs. The deterministic result places a case-sensitive `main.xs` first when one exists. The resolver emits exact paths and does not
pass unresolved patterns to the compiler.
The internal registry also carries the evaluated `compiler {}` warning, warnings-as-errors, and verbose policy. The
JVM-free compiler may replace those values for one invocation through its corresponding command-line overrides.

```text
./xs_kts/gradlew --daemon --build-cache -p xs_kts test
./xs_kts/gradlew --daemon --build-cache -p xs_kts run --args="evaluate xs_kts"
```

Project files are build programs and must be trusted. They are executed by the external `kotlin` script runner; xs-project
does not maintain or embed a substitute Kotlin interpreter. Kotlin scripting is not presented as a security sandbox.

Users build from the project directory with `xs build`. The JVM-free compiler asks `xs-project` for source metadata and
then keeps all X# frontend/backend work inside `xs`. The `xs-project sources0` form is an internal compiler/resolver
protocol, not an alternative X# build command.

`xs test` requests the separately resolved test registry and validates it together with project and module sources. The
current compiler command validates test sources but does not yet generate an executable `#[Test]` harness.
