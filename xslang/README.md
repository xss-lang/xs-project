# xslang

`xslang` is the target-independent Rust compiler core for the X# programming language. It provides typed HIR, MIR,
monomorphization and codegen-unit models, the human-readable XLIL v0 registry, and the early XGC model.

The public `xslang::xlil` API lets Rust tools and third-party language implementations construct, parse, verify, optimize,
and write XLIL without depending on LLVM. The corresponding C23 API is maintained in the xs-project repository under
`<xs/lil.h>` and `<xs/lil-c/*.h>`.

This crate is pre-1.0 compiler infrastructure. Its APIs and version-0 intermediate formats may evolve together with the X#
compiler. The repository pins a Rust nightly toolchain for reproducible development and validation.

Documentation and source are available in the [xs-project repository](https://github.com/xss-lang/xs-project).
