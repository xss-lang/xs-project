# XLIL

XLIL, the X# Low-Level Intermediate Language, is the compiler project's official low-level intermediate language.

XLIL sits before LLVM IR and is designed as the shared input point for all native backends.

## Purpose

- Provide a standard low-level intermediate language for X#.
- Remove direct LLVM IR coupling from frontend and middle-end layers.
- Give every backend a shared intermediate input.
- Provide the foundation for the future XS Backend.
- Allow other programming languages to generate XLIL and use the XS native backend pipeline.

## Shape

XLIL is:

- lower level than CIL,
- higher level than raw assembly,
- assembly-like without being assembly,
- target-independent,
- backend-independent,
- designed for native machine-code generation,
- not bytecode,
- not a virtual-machine instruction stream,
- always text,
- never binary.

## Registry format

`.xlil` files store registry-style records. Module records, function declarations, function definitions, types, and
future body records are stored as text.

An `.xlil` file is not executable bytecode. It is backend input.

## Public API

XLIL will expose a stable C23 API through:

```c
#include <xs/lil.h>
```

This header is the public API surface for AOT production and XLIL registry generation.

The API is intended to let:

- other programming languages generate XLIL,
- third-party compilers target XLIL,
- alternative frontends exist,
- every XLIL-producing compiler reuse the same backend infrastructure.
