# Build and test guide

xs-project is built on C23, CMake, Ninja, Clang/LLVM, and LLD. The documented and tested build path uses the Clang/LLVM
toolchain.

## Required tools

- `cmake` 3.31 or newer
- `ninja`
- `clang`
- LLVM tools:
  - `llvm-ar`
  - `llvm-ranlib`
  - `llvm-nm`
  - `llvm-objcopy`
  - `llvm-objdump`
  - `llvm-strip`
- `ld.lld`
- `rustup` and `cargo`; the pinned `xslang/rust-toolchain.toml` toolchain must be installed
- JRE 25, Gradle 9.6.1 or newer, and the Kotlin 2.4.0 `kotlin` script runner for the `jvm` project-test label

Useful helper tools:

- `fd`
- `rg`
- `bat -p`
- `sd`
- `busybox wc`
- `tokei`
- `uutils-coreutils` tools

## Default build

```text
cmake --preset clang-debug
cmake --build --preset clang-debug
ctest --preset clang-debug --output-on-failure
```

Preset details:

- generator: Ninja
- compiler: Clang
- shared monorepo and LLVM toolchain policy: the root `CMakeLists.txt`
- build directory: `build/clang-debug`
- default project: `xs`

The toolchain file selects and validates Clang, LLVM archive/object utilities, LLD, strict C23, and Ninja before project
targets are configured. The root build keeps project definitions separate from this tool selection. Test registration is
likewise split by direct XLIL, source values/control flow/calls, Kotlin projects, and library-level suites under
`cmake/XSTests*.cmake`.

The `xs` target builds `/usr/bin/xs` package payload code and the Rust `xslang` static library, then links its compiler-core
session API into the C23 driver. The same CMake configuration builds the `xs-proj` parser/validator executable. Building
`xsproj` alone remains C23-only and does not require Rust or LLVM.

The modern `xs-project` Kotlin resolver is built separately with Gradle:

```text
gradle -p xs_kts --no-daemon test installDist
```

It targets JVM 25 and runs on JRE 25 or newer. Runtime project evaluation also requires an external `kotlin` command with scripting
support; neither is embedded. The compiler command itself remains JVM-free.

## OOM-safe workflow

Parser/compiler tests have previously triggered OOM conditions. Use a 2GB virtual memory limit for native tests, excluding
the JVM-labelled Kotlin project integration tests:

```text
ulimit -v 2097152
cmake --build --preset clang-debug
ctest --preset clang-debug --output-on-failure -LE jvm
```

Then run the real `xs.project.kts` integration tests outside that virtual-address-space limit. A JVM reserves more virtual
address space than its live heap, so applying `ulimit -v 2097152` to this step is not valid:

```text
ctest --preset clang-debug --output-on-failure -L jvm
```

Tests are expected to run quickly. If a test suddenly consumes a lot of memory, treat it as a possible infinite loop, parser
progress bug, or runaway macro expansion.

## Sanitizer build

AddressSanitizer and UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer are available through the separate Clang preset:

```text
cmake --preset clang-sanitize
cmake --build --preset clang-sanitize
ctest --preset clang-sanitize --output-on-failure
```

Do not apply the 2GB virtual-memory limit to AddressSanitizer runs: its required shadow-memory reservation exceeds that
limit even when the program's real memory use is small.

## Project selection

Stable projects:

```text
cmake --preset clang-debug -DXS_ENABLE_PROJECTS=xs
cmake --preset clang-debug -DXS_ENABLE_PROJECTS=xsproj
cmake --preset clang-debug -DXS_ENABLE_PROJECTS=all
```

`xsproj` must not require the LLVM package when built by itself. Future projects (`xsfmt`, `xstidy`, and `xs-analyzer`)
intentionally produce CMake errors for now.

## Useful checks

```text
git diff --check
rg -n "\bNULL\b|#include <stdbool\.h>" xs xsproj tests include
busybox wc -l <file.c> <file.h>
```

Files must not exceed 1000 lines. New or touched C code should use `nullptr` and C23 `bool`.

## Build outputs

`build/` is a generated area. It may look dirty after build/test runs and should not be included in normal commits.
